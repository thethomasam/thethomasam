# Welcome to my GitHub Profile - Where I Turn Coffee into Code ‚òïÔ∏èüíª



Hey there! I'm Sam, a Machine Learning and AI enthisast with a love for Deep learning, Natural Language Processing,and Generative models an insatiable thirst for solving complex problems through code.

With over 1.5 years of experience in ML and Full Stack Developement, I have worked on a wide range of projects, from Devloping Language Model for a latent
representation of single-cells, to Devloping a Novel Adaptive weighted Supervised Autoencoder to use as a Digital Twin test bed,  each challenging me to push my skills to the limit.

My passion for ML & AI is what drives me to create clean, efficient, and scalable code that can stand the test of time. I believe that my GitHub profile is a testament to this passion, showcasing some of my most innovative and impressive projects to date.

But, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. So why not take a look at my repositories and see for yourself what I'm capable of? And if you're interested in collaborating or discussing a potential project, I'd love to hear from you!
